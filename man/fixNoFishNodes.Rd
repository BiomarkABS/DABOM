\title{Modify basic JAGS model}
\usage{
fixNoFishNodes(init_file = NULL, file_name = NULL, proc_ch = NULL,
  node_order = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{init_file}{name (with file path) of basic JAGS model.}

\item{file_name}{name (with file path) to save the model as.}

\item{proc_ch}{capture history as returned by one of the \code{processCapHist} family of functions in \code{PITcleanr} package, which has then been verified by a user and all blank UserProcStatus entries have been completed.}

\item{node_order}{output of function \code{createNodeOrder}}

\item{root_site}{initial tagging site}
}
\description{
Takes the basic JAGS model and modifies it based on particular observations. Specifically, it fixes the detection probability of all nodes that had no observations to 0.
